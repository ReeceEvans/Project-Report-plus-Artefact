# INTRODUCTION 

This assignment looks to solve the problem that many vegan people have when it comes to eating out, many vegans have issues when going out due to vegan options being limited across many restaurants. To solve this issue is the creation of a website that’ll allow vegans to find all restaurants that they can eat in.
Within this assignment, I will be following the design focused route rather than the development focused route. I will be discussing the creation of an in-depth high fidelity mockup that will be created using a tool such as InDesign and Sketch which will also be supported by a more simplistic single page web application (SPA). The SPA that will be created will be more of an interactive example of the web application that has been designed, based on this the main focus will be to show how the data will be conceptually represented in a web application; this may allow for place holder data to be used rather than making API calls. 

Through the assignment, I will partake in user research to work out who my users are and what needs they have upon completing this, I will use the data that I have gathered from surveys and focus groups. Based on this, I will be able to work out the functions and features that the design will need to provide. Upon the completion of user research, I will work on creating UX wireframes to get a feel of the design that will be used; the wireframes will be created based on users’ needs and design inspiration gathered from other websites and design guides that will be followed to ensure maximum functionality. Once the low fidelity wireframes have been created, I will be ready to start on the creation of the high fidelity mockup. Upon finishing this, user testing will be done to ensure that the mock-up is fit for users and any updates needed will be documented and implemented. 

When the mock-up has been created and tested, it will be version controlled and stored on a GitHub repo to ensure that it follows a modern workflow. The repository will contain supporting .md files such as readme.md and documentation.md. as well as include any supporting project assets, such as wireframes and completed test plans. readme.md will contain a brief overview of the project plus the appropriate instructions to ensure that a third party user would be run it locally. Whereas documentation.md will provide justification for the choices that have been made throughout the project. 
 
# DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

## RESPONSIVENESS

For the design of the application, I had to ensure that it is web friendly and that it would be responsive to ensure that it could be used on other devices. For this mock-up, I have created it so that it will be able to be used on all computer device. This means that it will be responsive to ensure that it will be viewable on screen from 11’ to 15’. To ensure that the mockup would be able to be used online, it has been created as if it was using a 16 grid system, this will allow it to be responsive once it has been decreased in size. 

## FONTS

To ensure that the mocks up fonts would be viewable across different browsers providing the mockup was created, I chose the best font available that allowed me to have maximum availability across devices and browsers. The font used is ‘Verdana’ this font is web safe font that is available on 99.84% of Windows devices and 99.1% of Apple devices. By using a web safe such as ‘Verdana’ I will be able to choose from several other fonts that come from the same family (san-serif) if this particular font is unavailable. 
 
## IMPLEMENTATION 

When it came to the production of the mock-up, I took the original wireframes that had been designed; I gathered some feedback on these to see what the users thought. A few issues arose:

•	Colours used were not appropriate for the design.
•	Layout was poor and didn’t allow much information to be displayed 
•	Confusing navigation 

Once these issues were sorted and the wireframes were updated again and were now high fidelity, I had a look and feel of how the mockup would be. From here I was able to start my design, I chose to use sketch as the main tool for the creation of the static layout and then use InVision later on to create an interactive feel. 
First of all, I started with an artboard that was set that it would rescale based on the device that it was being displayed on. This gave me the ability to view the mock-up on both laptop and computer without an issue. Upon adding the different features that I had implemented from the wireframes, I had my main layout. 

Now I had the separate sections in, I needed to add colour. I chose to use a light grey, white and black colour scheme. These colour were used based on the feedback I had received, the previous designs were featuring a lot of light colours that didn’t have the ability to show the different sections efficiently. The use of the blue colours in my designs was to show links and buttons as these were the stand out sections and this would help the users distinguish links and buttons from just simple text, this was changed based on feedback as the light blue contrasted too much compared to the simple minimal grey colour scheme that is used on the main design.  

The text within the application was set to be black so that details on the different restaurants would be clear and understandable for the user, the restaurant names were set to be bold so that the user would understand what restaurant they are looking at and know that if they were to click on the bold name or image that it would take them to a section of the site showing details of the particular restaurant. 

In order to contrast and ensure the text was clear on images and sections such as the footer that used white, the text was set to be black. When it came to displaying the locations of the restaurants, this was set to a dark grey, this was purely done to make the location contrast against the name and review that the location had received. 

With the buttons that are being used, these were created so that they would be obvious and stand out so that the users knew that is was button link. 

The search button was created in the same way but this a has a different feel as it is created in a lighter grey box that sits in with the header, this ensures that it stands out but with the search icon as well, this makes this button easier to be shown.

Now I had the main layout created, I was able to start turning the static pages into a clickable prototype.  
For the implementation to turn the static pages into a prototype, I used InVision and bumped my sketch work. This allowed me to add hotspots to my screens allowing me to link them to each other and give the feel of a proper website. To add the hotspots, it as simple as dragging a box over the area that needs to be linked and then clicking the link to choose where it will be linked to. Once I had done all the hotspots, I had a full working interactive prototype. 

 
# User Research

## Surveys

To help understand the types of individuals that would be using my website, I create a survey that will have members of the public answering and stating their thoughts on how they feel towards eating out, how they choice to eat out plus their dietary preferences and then it will follow onto see how they feel towards veganism and whether they would choose to eat out at vegan only restaurants. The use of the survey aims to provide me with the types of users that I can expect to be using the site.

# Methods

## AGILE WORKFLOW

For the development of my mock-up, I chose to follow the agile workflow as this is an iteration process that allows me to set each task to have a fixed completion time. With this method being based on time, it makes the iteration process methodical and the scope for each interaction as broad as the time it is allowed for completion. Due to this, there will be multiple iterations that will be followed during the agile developments life cycle until the final product is completed.

The iteration process flow that will be followed is:

* Requirements – this will research the users and looked into the requirements that will be needed for the mock-up. 
* Development – this section will design and develop mock-up based on defined requirements
* Testing – this will test the mock-up to ensure that there are no issues.
* Delivery – upon completion of testing, this will get the mock-up ready for release. 
* Feedback – this section will test and give feedback on the mockup and check whether further requirements are needed if so this will loop back to requirements and the workflow will start again.

## TOOLS

When it came to the implementation of the prototype, tools such as Sketch and InVision were used for the main creation of the design, as well as the use of online wireframe creators such as wireframe.cc to traditional methods such as designing of low fidelity wireframes on paper.

### Sketch

Sketch is a tool that features an extensive interface that allows multiple different tools to be used at once. Sketch has been the main design tool used; within the sketch app it has:

* Allowed me to create wireframes 
* Allowed me to create my mockup
* Allowed me to create icons and symbols

Sketch was the main tool that has used to create the high fidelity wireframes, this due to sketch having a wide range of features and tools that help to add the development of the mock-up. With sketch having pre-set artboards available, it has made it possible to set one artboard and then set this to scale based on the device it is being viewed on so that the design will be responsive whether being used on a big or small device.

One of the main reasons that I chose to use sketch is that it features all the tools and components that I needed to create the mockup but it also presents them in a simple and easy to use manner. The second reason that I chose to use Sketch is that I will be able to create the high fidelity wireframes for the mock-up and then link this to the InVision app allowing me to create a clickable prototype which will allow me to make my mockup responsive based on how the user interacts with it. 

## Invision

Following on from sketch, the next tool that I chose to use is InVision, this due to it allowing my sketch file to be linked within InVision and then be updated by the tools that are available inside the InVision application. 
InVision has allowed me to take a static mockup and create a clickable prototype. With the tools it has available, it possible for users to click links and give them the ability to see what would happen upon pressing that without having to create and upload the website online. This tool will give me the ability to show what it would be like if a user was trying to gather data from the API since they could search and I can create a page that would take them directly to what they are looking for, this would create an interactive example of the web application. 

Another feature that InVision has is that it has the ability to generate working code that uses accurate measurements, assets, and styles. This feature is extremely beneficial to the creation of this mockup as currently, it’s only a mock-up web page but if it was to be developed, this would allow me to have all my created styles and asset already coded and just need to be added within the style of the HTML page, this feature just helps to promote a faster workflow and allow the web page to be used sooner.

# REFLECTION

When I came to completing this assignment, I was able to benefit from a variety of new skills as well as refresh and further some previous things that I already knew. There were a couple of issues that were faced during the completion of this assignment, one of the main issues that I experienced was time management, this was due to having a lot of outstanding projects to complete as well as this. Despite this, I did make some changes to my life to ensure that time management wouldn’t be an issue when completing this assignment. To ensure that this assignment would be completed, I followed a strict learning guide that ensured that I would be able to work on this assignment for up to 4 hours a day across the time until submission. By following this guide, it allowed me to keep track of the time left against the process that I had made.

The second issues that were faced were learning how to create an interactive prototype, this wasn’t a huge issue as over my time at university I have had quite a lot of experience in making these. Some issues that were faced was making sure that the design was fit for purpose and following design principles to make the interface user-friendly. To ensure that I overcome these issues, researching online and using previous lecture notes help to give me the knowledge that I needed.

Within this assignment, I had learned things that I didn’t know such as how an API works and how it is used within the industry. As well as this I’ve learned new coding techniques and how to code within the terminal to connect GIT and cloud9 software. The highlight of this assignment was being able to design the artifact as this is what I like to do to express myself and my creative side. As well as this, being able to create this artifice has allowed me to further my skills on InVision and Sketch with are both tools that are used in the industry and will be vital skills that I will need upon completing university.
