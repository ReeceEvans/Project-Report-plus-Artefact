This assignment looks to solve the problem that many vegan people have when it comes to eating out, many vegans have issues when going out due to vegan options being limited across many restaurants. To solve this issue, is the creation of a website that’ll allow vegans to find all restaurants that they can eat in.
Within this assignment, I will be following the design focused route rather than the development focused route. I will be discussing the creation of an in-depth high fidelity mock up that will be created using tool such as InDesign and Sketch which will also be supported by a more simplistic single page web application (SPA). The SPA that will be created will be more of an interactive example of the web application that has been designed, based on this the main focus will be to show how the data will be conceptually represented in a web application; this may allow for place holder data to be used rather than making API calls. 

Through the assignment, I will partake in user research to work out who my users are and what needs they have upon completing this, I will use the data that I have gathered from surveys and focus groups. Based on this, I will be able to work out the functions and features that the design will need to provide. Upon the completion of user research, I will work on creating UX wireframes to get a feel of the design that will be used; the wireframes will be created based on users’ needs and design inspiration gathered from other websites and design guides that will be followed to ensure maximum functionality. Once the low fidelity wireframes have been created, I will be ready to start on the creation of the high fidelity mock up. Upon finishing this, user testing will be done to ensure that the mock up is fit for users and any updates needed will be documented and implemented. 

When the mock up has been created and tested, it will be version controlled and stored on a GitHub repo to ensure that it follows a modern workflow. The repository will contain supporting .md files such as readme.md and documentation.md. as well as include any supporting project assets, such as wire frames and completed test plans. readme.md will contain a brief overview of the project plus the appropriate instructions to ensure that a third party user would be run it locally. Whereas documentation.md will provide justification of the choices that have been made throughout the project.
